<p> - In my classes of Discrete Mathematics we are learning about logic and consequently, Truth Table.</p>
<p> - Then a colleague suggested the use of a Truth Table Generator from web, and I have been thinking that this would be a good challenge to try: create my own Truth Table Generator.</p>
<p> - This was my first really good project, as I put a lot of effort into solving a problem with logic and creativity. It lacks some minor functionalities but is working normally.</p>
<h2>About the project </h2>
<p> - The code is able to build truth tables performing AND, OR and CONDITIONAL, NEGATION operations. (some other too maybe, I don't remember, I'm updating this after 9 months!!)</p>
<p> - The truth table begins from right to left to take the operations.</p>
<p> - Returns if the proposition is a Tautology, Contigency or Contradiction.</p>
<p> - The code is being designed for OOP. I think it's getting more organized and easier to deal with.</p>
<p> - (I'm not getting too much time to focus on this due my college and work, so I spending some few hours after midnight to code)</p>

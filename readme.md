<h1>Truth Table Generator Web App</h1>
<p> - In my classes of Discrete Mathematics we are learning about logic and consequently, Truth Table.</p>
<p> - Then a colleague suggested the use of a Truth Table Generator from web, and I have been thinking that this would be a good challenge to try: create my own Truth Table Generator.</p>
<p> -  The code isn't done yet, so I will work daily on this until done. This algorithm has been a great challenge, and probably will not be 100% perfect as could be, but when possible I will make enhancements</p>
<p> -  I'm planning to first implement all operations (->, <->, =, v, ^, !) and after reduce the amount of code in smart ways.</p>
